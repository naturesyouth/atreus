* Atreus Keyboard

The Atreus is a mechanical keyboard designed primarily to match the
shape of human hands and to be as portable as possible. The case
measures 26x12cm and lacks even a number row, relying heavily upon the
=fn= key. There is a circuit board for this design, but it's also
possible to [[http://wiki.geekhack.org/index.php?title=Hard-Wiring_How-To][manually wire the matrix]].

I've seen a number of existing DIY 40% keyboard designs, but most of
them stagger the rows, which I find very annoying now that I've gotten
used to the columnar layout of the [[http://ergodox.org][Ergodox]]. In addition, many of the
designs I've seen waste a lot of room on the space bar, failing to
take into account the fact that the thumb is the strongest and most
versatile of the fingers. This design avoids both these problems while
taking a more couch-friendly single-piece approach.

See [[./changelog.md][the changelog]] for the various revisions made to the design since
its initial release.

** Kits

You can buy [[http://atreus.technomancy.us][Atreus kits]] that have all the parts you need along with
detailed assembly instructions from http://atreus.technomancy.us. If
you'd rather round up all the parts yourself, that's possible too
since the design is completely open source; see the bill of materials
below.

** Layout

Only a handful of punctuation marks (and no digits) are available
unshifted, and all the modifiers are on the bottom row:

 :    q     w     e     r     t       ||       y     u     i     o    p
 :    a     s     d     f     g       ||       h     j     k     l    ;
 :    z     x     c     v     b       ||       n     m     ,     .    /
 :   esc   tab  super shift bksp ctrl || alt space  fn     -     '  enter

The numbers and most of the punctuation are on the fn layer with a
numpad-style arrangement under the right hand:

 :    !     @     {     }     |       ||     pgup    7     8     9    *
 :    #     $     (     )     `       ||     pgdn    4     5     6    +
 :    %     ^     [     ]     ~       ||       \     1     2     3    ?
 :   L2  insert super shift bksp ctrl || alt space   fn    .     0    =

The =L2= key switches it to the function layer, and tapping =L0= here
brings it back to the first layer.

 :  insert home    ↑    end  pgup     ||       ↑     F7    F8    F9   F10
 :    del   ←      ↓     →   pgdn     ||       ↓     F4    F5    F6   F11
 :                                    ||             F1    F2    F3   F12
 :              super shift bksp ctrl || alt space   L0             reset

The [[https://github.com/technomancy/atreus-firmware][firmware project]] includes a number of other options, including
colemak, dvorak, and "software dvorak" which sends keycodes assuming
the OS will perform the translation into dvorak. Adding new layouts or
changing existing ones is easy.

** Parts

*** Switches

This layout has five modifiers and 37 non-modifiers.

I strongly prefer the feel and sound of tactile [[http://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=651][Cherry MX blue]]
switches for typing. However, I like having linear [[http://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=103][Cherry MX black
switches]] switches on the modifier keys (ctrl, alt, super, shift, and
fn) because the tactile effect has no benefit for keys that are held
down, and giving a different response helps you learn the layout more
quickly.

For users that need to operate in sound-sensitive environments like
open offices or libraries, [[http://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX_Clear][Cherry MX Clear]] switches are a popular
choice since they still offer tactility withut the noise.

*** Diodes

In order to avoid ghosting, each switch needs a diode. The [[https://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062587][1N4148]] is a
readily-available choice, but nearly any signal diode would work.

*** Microcontroller

The circuit board design uses a [[http://www.pololu.com/product/3101][Pololu A-star micro]]. Hand-wired boards
can also use a [[http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html][Teensy 2]] or [[http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardMicro][Arduino Pro Micro]].

Be sure to get a microcontroller without headers so it will fit in
between the bottom layer and the plate. USB micro is preferred over
USB mini for this reason as well.

*** Keycaps

This [[http://keyshop.pimpmykeyboard.com/products/full-keysets/dsa-blank-sets-1][DSA-shaped base set]] (spherical indentations on the key, same
profile for each row) from Signature Plastics has 52 1x keys plus a
few extras we won't use. There are two "deep dish" keys in that set
which you can place under your index fingers on the home row to help
guide your hands to the right spot without looking. However, you only
get a single 1.5x keycap, and the middle two thumb keys both use them,
so you might want to pick up an extra.

Many keycap sets (not the one linked above) are "sculpted", meaning
that keys that go in different rows have a different shape. While you
can use these for an Atreus, it's unlikely you'll find a set with the
correct number for each row, so it's more wasteful.

** Circuit Board

The =atreus.rkt= program calculates switch and diode positions based
on row/column counts, spacing, and rotation factors, and emits a
=atreus.kicad_pcb= file. The board outline and traces are done by hand
and are stored in the =header.rktd= and =traces.rktd= files
respectively. The =atreus.kicad_pcb= file can be imported into [[http://kicad.org][Kicad]]
which can export Gerber files suitable for fabrication. A copy of the
Kicad PCB file is included in the repository if you don't want to
recompile it using Racket. Recompiling is only required if you want to
make changes to the procedurally-generated portions of the board.

Unfortunately most PCB fabricators require a minimum order of 10 or
so, making this impractical for one-offs. The PCB is not required, so
for one-off boards it's usually more sensible to stick with a [[http://atreus.technomancy.us/assembly-hand-wired.pdf][hand-wired build]] instead.

** Case

Layered laser-cut wood or acrylic. The original case (=case-mk-i.svg=)
is slightly less wide and has a minor asymmetry with the screws on the
bottom side. The [[http://geekhack.org/index.php?topic%3D54759.msg1304117#msg1304117][mark II case]] (in the =case/dxf= directory) is
available as a DFX file that you can convert to SVG or EPS for a laser
cutter using Inkscape. Mark II features 8 screw holes and a kind of "stair
step" design around the top and bottom of the key clusters; mark I is
pictured below.

TODO: the logo is missing from some of the case files and needs to be added back in.

There is also a programmatically-implemented version of the case
written in OpenSCAD; it is more flexible (you can tweak the number of
rows/cols, etc and recompile) but it doesn't match the canonical case
exactly; in particular the screw holes are placed differently.

[[./layers.jpg]]

The first two shapes in the case file are the top and bottom covers;
these should be cut on 3mm acrylic (black in the photo). The third is
the spacer that goes under the fourth, which is the plate on which the
switches are mounted. These should be cut in 6mm, especially the
spacer, which needs to be at least as thick as the mini USB cable you
connect to the microcontroller. I recommend using a mini USB cable
with as thin a connector as you can find or sanding the connector
down to the required thickness. The switch plate could be thinner, but
not under 3mm.

On a 100W Epilog laser, the 3mm layers cut in about a minute and a
half. I did a run with 6mm acrylic of the other layers which took
nearly 6 minutes.

Wood cases should be finished with sandpaper and finishding oil/wax.

** Firmware

The [[https://github.com/technomancy/atreus-firmware/][custom Atreus firmware]] is a small C project which
implements matrix scanning and debouncing with user-customizeable
layers and macro functions. Another option is the much more complex
TMK firmware. My [[https://github.com/technomancy/tmk_keyboard/tree/atreus][fork of the tmk firmware]] has support for the Atreus
layout. You should be able to change into the =keyboard/atreus=
directory and run =make KEYMAP=atreus= (or whichever variant you want)
to produce a qwerty =atreus.hex= file. You will probably want to
create your own layout once you've gotten a chance to try it and see
what works for you.

In either case you would use the =.hex= file you just produced with
=avrdude= or the [[http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html][teensy loader]] to upload to the microcontroller. =make
upload= should do what you need.

Once the firmware is loaded and the keyboard is assembled, activating
the hardware reset to upload new versions of the firmware is pretty
cumbersome; instead use the "reset" button on the layout, which has
the same effect.

** Bill of Materials

- 50 MX Blue switches: $29.00 (mechanicalkeyboards.com)
- 50 diodes: $3.45 (radio shack, should be able to buy in-person)
- Base blank DSA keycap set: $23.00 (signatureplastics.com)
- Teensy 2: $16, $3 shipping (pjrc.com)
- Case materials: ~$16, varies by source
- Case laser cutting: 7.5 minutes on a 100W Epilog laser; varies by source
- USB micro cable: $5, various sources

Recommended but optional:

- 5 MX Red or MX Black switches: $8.50 - $10.00
- additional 1.5x DSA keycap: $1 plus $8 shipping

The base keycap set only has one 1.5x key, which is used for the inner
thumb keys. You can use a 1x key for one of them, but it looks kind of
tacky, so I recommend getting a second 1.5x keycap separately.

*** Other Tools

You'll need a soldering iron, solder, and a wire cutter. A multimeter
can come in handy for testing the connections but is optional. You'll
also need eight M3 machine screws with nuts; the length of the screws
depends on the thickness of the acrylic you use. You can add rubber
feet to the bottom to prevent the board from sliding around when
placed on a desk. You'll also need sandpaper and finishing oil for the
wooden cases unless you have bought a kit.

If you are building a hand-wired board you will also need a glue gun,
hookup wire, and wire strippers.

** Assembly

See the [[http://atreus.technomancy.us/assembly.pdf][assembly instructions]] PDF.

Hand-wired boards will want the [[http://atreus.technomancy.us/assembly-hand-wired.pdf][previous edition of the assembly instructions]].

The LaTeX source to the assembly instructions is in the =assembly= directory.

** Inspiration

These fine projects all provided inspiration for various aspects of
the Atreus, as well as the folks on the =#geekhack= freenode channel.

** Orestes

A new [[https://www.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/14654421878][experimental build]] uses the [[http://pjrc.com/store/teensy31.html][Teensy 3]] microcontroller and
ARM [[https://github.com/technomancy/orestes/tree/teensy3][Forth-based]] firmware, but this is not yet suitable for general-purpose use.
